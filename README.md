# Pong Game

A basic pong game using HTML5 Canvas. The game consists of five rounds with a progressively increasing difficulty level.  Difficulty is increased each round with an increasing number of balls and shrinking paddle sizes.

This game was developed using JavaScript ES6 and is intended to demonstrate the use of classes and object-oriented programming with JavaScript.

## Setup
##### Install
`> npm i`
##### Run
`> npm start`
## Keys
##### Player 1:
* a: up
* z: down
##### Player 2:
* ▲ : up
* ▼: down

## Technologies Used

- HTML Canvas
- JavaScript ES5 & ES6
- Model-View-Controller design pattern
- Webpack

## Personal Learnings

This project allowed me to gain understanding of using JavaScript ES6 for class-based object-oriented programming.

The project was developed using a model-view-controller design pattern with the view being implemented by index.html, the models by the JavaScript classes and the controller by the index.js file.  Use was made of JaveScript Import/ Export statements to connect the program structure.
